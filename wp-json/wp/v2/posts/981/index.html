The woman had always been wanting to have a dog for a long time. However, as she had an affinity for big pups, she waited until she moved to a house with more space. After she bought her first house, she browsed through the Humane Society for Hamilton County\u2019s website and Facebook page every morning to find a perfect dog for herself. Eventually, she found what she wished for when she saw Ritter\u2019s heart-wrenching picture.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/pup-no-one-wants-4-256x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-985\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/pup-no-one-wants-4-256x300.jpg 256w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/pup-no-one-wants-4-300x352.jpg 300w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/pup-no-one-wants-4.jpg 530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I saw Ritter\u2019s picture and description go up at 6 a.m. one morning, I immediately texted my sister and said we had to go bust him outta there right after work,\u201d Spenia said. \u201cTwo hours later, my sister texted me the Facebook post that she noticed was going viral. So I told my boss the situation and he told me to clock out and get over to the shelter!
