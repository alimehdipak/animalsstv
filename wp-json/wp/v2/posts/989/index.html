Thanks to the love and care of the staff of the rescue center, the cubs began to stay normally again. They groomed, cuddled, and played with each other.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Nxy4LGb-300x198.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"198\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-994\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Nxy4LGb-300x198.png 300w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Nxy4LGb-1024x677.png 1024w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Nxy4LGb-768x508.png 768w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Nxy4LGb-350x230.png 350w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Nxy4LGb-850x562.png 850w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Nxy4LGb.png 1353w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The trio soon became inseparable, living as siblings.
