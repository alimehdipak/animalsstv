The reason behind such reaction could be the \u201cNapoleon Complex\u201d \u2013 a theorized inferiority complex that is often attributed to people of short stature.<\/p>\n<p>Apparently, the angry crow did prepare for a fight. But for some reason, it simply had no idea what to do next after landing smoothly on the big bird.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Clever-Crow-Spotted-Hitching-A-Ride-On-Flying-Bald-Eagles-Back-3-1-300x208.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"208\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1046\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Clever-Crow-Spotted-Hitching-A-Ride-On-Flying-Bald-Eagles-Back-3-1-300x208.jpg 300w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Clever-Crow-Spotted-Hitching-A-Ride-On-Flying-Bald-Eagles-Back-3-1.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis would be kind of like a dog chasing a car and jumping up on it,\u201d says McGowan. \u201cDogs always want to catch the car, but they never know what they\u2019d do if they get it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>According to McGowan, the bald eagle\u2019s nonchalance is completely understandable either. As the largest predatory birds, eagles are always harassed by other birds and they actually don\u2019t think of it as a big deal.
