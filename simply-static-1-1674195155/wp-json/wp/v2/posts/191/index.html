She is very sick and her life will soon come to an end. She got all the attention she needed, but she missed her horses Bob and Monty and Rowley and her dogs Monty and Rowley.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5430\" src=\"https:\/\/forever-love-animals.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/2-12.jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/forever-love-animals.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/2-12.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/forever-love-animals.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/2-12-150x110.jpeg 150w\" alt=\"\" width=\"845\" height=\"617\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The woman said that Bob was a very important part of her life and that she had been riding him up until the day before she went to the hospital. After seeing Jan\u2019s trouble, the staff decided to surprise her by adding her three animal friends to the list of guests. This led to a happy get-together. The staff at the hospice finished getting ready before taking Jan to the entrance to the courtyard to give him the sweet surprise.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5431\" src=\"https:\/\/forever-love-animals.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/3-12.jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 878px) 100vw, 878px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/forever-love-animals.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/3-12.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/forever-love-animals.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/3-12-150x114.jpeg 150w\" alt=\"\" width=\"878\" height=\"664\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Jan knew that her horse was hers. When he got there, the people who work at the Thornleigh Park Farm Stables, where Bob lives freely, were with him. Even though she couldn\u2019t get out of bed, the woman\u2019s face showed that she was happy, especially when she thought about the chance of seeing Bob again. Bob sat on Jan\u2019s lap and immediately stroked her neck, putting his head through the door so that Jan could touch him.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5425\" src=\"https:\/\/forever-love-animals.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/4-11.jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 885px) 100vw, 885px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/forever-love-animals.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/4-11.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/forever-love-animals.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/4-11-150x141.jpeg 150w\" alt=\"\" width=\"885\" height=\"832\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"quads-ad5040\" class=\"quads-location quads-ad5040 \">\n<div id=\"udm-inpage-2\" class=\"udm-inpage udm-loaded\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"quads-ad5233\" class=\"quads-location quads-ad5233 \"><\/div>\n<p>He also liked the apples, bananas, and carrots that she gave him because they were sweet. She was so happy that her face shone. Jan says: ,,I was still riding Bob every day up until a few weeks ago. He\u2019s a pretty important part of my life, and I\u2019ve missed him a lot.\u201d Monty and Rowley, her two puppies, came and slept by her bed, which was the best part of the emotional reunion.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5426\" src=\"https:\/\/forever-love-animals.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/5-9.jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/forever-love-animals.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/5-9.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/forever-love-animals.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/5-9-150x134.jpeg 150w\" alt=\"\" width=\"880\" height=\"786\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"quads-ad5042\" class=\"quads-location quads-ad5042 \">\n<div id=\"udm-inpage-3\" class=\"udm-inpage udm-loaded\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Jan hadn\u2019t been able to say goodbye to her dogs before she went to the hospital, so she was happy to see them again.
